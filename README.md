# Maze Runner
## About
 A game to simulate the player running through the maze, with possible killing obstacles, evil hitmen and many more.


### Basic Mode
* The level moves to the left at a constant speed. The mouse cursor is the player, and you must first click the character and move the mouse to navigate between the walls.
* Touching a wall results in him dying.
* Score based on distance travelled.
* The game is side-scrolling and infinite.
* Pause/Resume ( P ), Quit ( Q ), Restart ( R ) buttons included.

### Hacker Mode
* The mouse cursor is the player, and you must first click the character and move the mouse to navigate between the walls.
    * The mouse is only a guide. The player runs at a constant speed, so the mouse will only decide the relative direction of movement. He will only follow the mouse.
* Enemies/Hitmen with guns and projectiles.
* The walls are real walls now, they no longer kill the player(unlike Basic mode). They will simply not allow him to pass through. He has to be squished against the back wall by an obstacle in order to die (or be hit by an enemy).
* Score based on distance travelled.
*  Increase in difficulty with faster movement and more enemies as the level goes on.
*  The mouse cursor can be used to shoot bombs or keys WASD can be used to shoot bombs in directions. 
* Pause/Resume ( P ), Quit ( Q ), Restart ( R ) buttons included.
